I visited Youtube on the Wayback Machine. I explored a lot of different years, but the earliest version was all the way
back in 2005. It is definetely way different than it is now. It looked a lot more basic in it's layout, very similar to beginner 
websites like what we're doing now. Comparing that to present time, it's a lot more organized, easier to navigate, and just overall
more convenient.
