            <i>At the Mountains of Madness</i> is a sci-fi cosmic horror novella about a disasterous expedition to Antarctica. From a short 
            synopsis, the story is told by a series of events yet to be described by a geologist to dissuade other group of explorers 
            from exploring the continent. </p>
        <p>
            The events are described by the findings of an ancient civilization that have been there longer than humanity 
            and finding untold stories of the Earth's past through murals, until disaster inevitably strikes.
