A lot of sites use forms that are straight to the point and it's job is to communicate to the user it's easy to understand and implement information forward. I did have a question about butt submissions. When you send information, how does the receiver of the information get it? Do they get it from a separate server or another html-type document? I tried testing it out here on my site and I think the submissions are being sent to an abyss in some way, probably because I didn't set up another page to receive it.
