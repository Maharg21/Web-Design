A lot of sites use forms that are straight to the point and it's job is to communicate to the user it's easy to understand and implement information forward. I did have a question about butt submissions. When you send information, how does the receiver of the information get it? Do they get it from a separate server or another html-type document? I tried testing it out here on my site and I think the submissions are being sent to an abyss in some way, probably because I didn't set up another page to receive it. 

![screenshot](Assignment07/images/screenshot.jpg) - This seems to be the only method of linking an image to a markdown file I could find online, and I can't seem to get the link to work even. I don't know if it'll work now, but again would be very appreciative to let me know where I might've missed it in the lesson.
