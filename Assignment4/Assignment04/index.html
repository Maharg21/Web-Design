            I've done some of this kind of thing before, still a bit rusty, but I have the basics all down.

            I'm not the biggest fan of coding mainly because of how you need to write everything in a pitch perfect way,
            but I can understand the interest in it. For me I always somehow miss one or two tiny little thing that affects
            something.
