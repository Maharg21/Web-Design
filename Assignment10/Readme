Element Selectors are what selects a tag, and ID selector types help identify a single element in an HTML, and Classes help identify more than one element in an HTML.
Then Universal Selectors help match elements of any type of element or namespace. 

I was actually having a tough time trying to find two good colors that compliment with the portrait. The portrait has a dark look to it, but the portrait itself has a funny aspect to it, 
so I went with choosing a somewhat less saturated blue with a yellow background. Typically these two colors help convey humor, and while it looks a little odd with the dark look of the image, I 
went with it because having the colors compliment the image itself rather than it's colors was more important.
