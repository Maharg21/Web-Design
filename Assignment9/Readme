Html is definetly my most comfortable field of work right now, but it's still not my cup of tea still. 
It's definetly the easiest in my opinion to understand, however I still find it difficult to get everything to look just right, which is why I kept mine simple and to the point.

I think I'm working with CSS right now in another class, so I should understand most of everything. 
However I'm still not great at it. Hopefully this slower approach will be better. 

Also, I tried using the nav and div, but I kept getting errors mostly using the ":" for some odd reason, so the pages are linked together at the bottom. (not in a very visually pleasing way unfortunately) 
It was taking me too long to fix it, so I just used standard hyperlinks at the bottom
