Took a very simple, minimaliztic approach to the site. There's nothing much to it, just wanted to make things easy for users. 

My subpages still need some visual tweaking according to my testers, I'll be sure to get those changes for the final draft. 

The User testings were okay. I'm usually home-alone most of the time so it was a bit hard finding some folks (used a couple relatives) 

I actually spent a lot of time fixing my homepage (lots of troubleshooting), so I didn't quite get a chance to tweak my subpages. But like I said, I'll be sure to fix them for next week.
The changes I did make were primarily the homepage. I simplified it a lot, and it makes it look more clean and concise. I had some issues trying to make the images line up in a triangular formation like my draft, but
it was a lot of hassle for something small, so I went with the row and column tags.
